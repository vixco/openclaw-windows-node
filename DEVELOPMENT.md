## Prerequisites

### Required

- **.NET 10 SDK** - [Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- **Windows 10/11** - WinUI 3 and Windows App SDK require Windows 10 version 1903 or later
- **WebView2 Runtime** - Usually pre-installed on Windows 10+ ([Manual download](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/))
- **Visual Studio 2022** (optional) - For easier development and debugging with WinUI 3 designer support

### For Testing

- **A running OpenClaw gateway instance** - The gateway provides the backend for chat, sessions, and notifications
  - Default gateway URL: `ws://localhost:18789`
  - You'll need a valid authentication token from your OpenClaw instance

### For PowerToys Extension Development

- **PowerToys** (latest version) - Required for testing the Command Palette extension
  - [Download PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)

## Building

### Build the Entire Solution

From the repository root:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

This builds all projects (Shared library, Tray app, Command Palette extension).

### Build Individual Projects

**Shared Library:**
```bash
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Shared
```

**Tray App (WinUI):**
```bash
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI
```

**Command Palette Extension:**
```bash
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.CommandPalette -p:Platform=x64
```

Note: Command Palette requires explicit platform (`x64` or `arm64`).

### Platform and Architecture Notes

#### x64 vs ARM64

The solution supports both Intel/AMD (x64) and ARM (arm64) architectures:

- **Tray App**: Can be built for either architecture
  ```bash
  dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI -r win-x64
  dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI -r win-arm64
  ```

- **Command Palette**: Must match your system architecture
  ```bash
  # On x64 systems:
  dotnet build src/OpenClaw.CommandPalette -p:Platform=x64
  
  # On ARM64 systems:
  dotnet build src/OpenClaw.CommandPalette -p:Platform=arm64
  ```

> **⚠️ Important for ARM64 Users**: Both the Command Palette extension AND the Tray app must be built for ARM64 architecture for WebView2 and deep links to work correctly. Running an x64 build on ARM64 will cause errors.

#### Cross-Platform Building

The Shared library is cross-platform and can be built on Windows, Linux, or macOS:

```bash
cd src/OpenClaw.Shared
dotnet build
```

The WinUI Tray app and Command Palette are Windows-only but can be built on Linux using:

```bash
dotnet build -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true
```

### Running in Debug Mode

#### Visual Studio

1. Open `moltbot-windows-hub.slnx` in Visual Studio 2022
2. Set `OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI` as the startup project
3. Press F5 to run with debugging

#### Command Line

```bash
dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI
```

For verbose output:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI -c Debug
```

#### Command Palette Development

Use the provided helper script for rapid iteration:

```bash
.\tools\cmdpal-dev.ps1 cycle
```

This script:
1. Removes the currently installed extension
2. Builds the extension for your platform
3. Deploys it via `Add-AppxPackage -Register`
4. Reminds you to run "Reload" in Command Palette

Manual steps:
```powershell
# Build
dotnet build src/OpenClaw.CommandPalette -p:Platform=x64

# Deploy (development mode, no MSIX needed)
$manifest = "src/OpenClaw.CommandPalette/bin/x64/Debug/net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0/win-x64/AppxManifest.xml"
Add-AppxPackage -Register $manifest -ForceApplicationShutdown

# Test: Open PowerToys Command Palette (Win+Alt+Space), type "Reload", then "OpenClaw"
```

### Publishing (Self-Contained)

For distribution:

```bash
dotnet publish src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -o publish
```

This creates a standalone executable with all dependencies bundled.

## Architecture Overview

### Gateway WebSocket Connection

The `OpenClawGatewayClient` manages the connection to the OpenClaw gateway:

**Connection Flow:**
1. WebSocket connects to gateway URL (default: `ws://localhost:18789`)
2. Client waits for `challenge` event from gateway
3. Client responds with authentication token
4. Gateway sends `connected` event confirming authentication
5. Client begins receiving events and can send requests

**Reconnect & Backoff Logic:**
- Automatic reconnection on disconnect or error
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 15s, 30s, 60s (max)
- Resets backoff counter on successful connection
- Connection state exposed via `StatusChanged` event

**Implementation:**
```csharp
// Backoff sequence in milliseconds
private static readonly int[] BackoffMs = { 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 15000, 30000, 60000 };
```

### Event Parsing and Notification Types

The gateway sends structured events over WebSocket. The client parses these into typed notifications:

#### Event Types

| Event Type | Handler | Description | UI Result |
|------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `challenge` | Initial handshake | Gateway requests authentication | Client sends token |
| `connected` | Authentication success | Gateway confirms connection | Status → Connected |
| `agent` (stream=job) | `HandleJobEvent` | Job/task activity | Activity indicator, tray badge |
| `agent` (stream=tool) | `HandleToolEvent` | Tool execution (exec, read, write, etc.) | Activity with tool name + args |
| `chat` | `HandleChatEvent` | Assistant chat messages | Toast notification for short messages |
| `health` | `ParseChannelHealth` | Channel health status | Channel status in tray menu |
| `session` | `HandleSessionEvent` | Session list updates | Session display refresh |
| `usage` | `ParseUsage` | Token usage, cost, requests | Usage info in status window |

#### Notification Classification

Notifications are classified using two strategies:

1. **Structured** (preferred): Events with explicit `type`, `category`, or `notificationType` fields
2. **Text-based** (fallback): Keyword matching on notification content

**Categories:**
- `health` - Blood sugar, glucose, CGM readings
- `urgent` - Critical alerts requiring immediate attention
- `reminder` - Calendar reminders, tasks
- `stock` - Stock price alerts
- `email` - Email notifications
- `calendar` - Calendar events
- `error` - Error messages
- `build` - CI/CD build status
- `info` - General information (default)

**Routing:**
- Notifications trigger Windows toast notifications (if enabled in settings)
- Stored in notification history for later review
- Can be filtered by category

### WebView2 Lifecycle

The `WebChatWindow` uses Microsoft Edge WebView2 for embedded web content:

**Initialization:**
1. WebView2 control created in XAML
2. `CoreWebView2` environment initialized on window load
3. User data folder: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenClawTray\WebView2`
4. Navigation guard prevents external navigation

**Lifecycle:**
```
Window Created → WebView2.EnsureCoreWebView2Async() → Navigate to Chat URL → User Interaction → Window Hidden (not disposed)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Singleton pattern**: Only one WebChat window instance exists
- **Hidden instead of disposed**: Window is hidden when closed to preserve state
- **Separate user data folder**: Isolates cookies/storage from browser
- **Navigation guard**: Prevents accidental navigation away from chat

**Implementation:**
```csharp
// Initialize WebView2 environment
await WebView.EnsureCoreWebView2Async();
WebView.CoreWebView2.Navigate(chatUrl);

// Navigation guard
WebView.CoreWebView2.NavigationStarting += (s, e) => {
    if (!e.Uri.StartsWith(allowedHost)) {
        e.Cancel = true;
    }
};
```

### GDI Handle Management

The tray icon system uses GDI handles for icon creation. Proper management prevents handle leaks:

**Icon Creation Pattern:**
```csharp
// Create bitmap
using var bitmap = new Bitmap(16, 16);
using var graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);
graphics.DrawSomething(...);

// Convert to icon (creates GDI handle)
var hIcon = bitmap.GetHicon();
var icon = Icon.FromHandle(hIcon);

// Clone to own the data
var result = (Icon)icon.Clone();

// CRITICAL: Destroy the GDI handle
DestroyIcon(hIcon);

return result;
```

**Why This Matters:**
- GDI handles are a limited system resource (10,000 per process on Windows)
- Not calling `DestroyIcon()` causes handle leaks
- Each tray icon update could leak a handle without proper cleanup
- The pattern: Create → Clone → Destroy ensures we own the icon data and release the GDI handle

**Caching:**
Icons are cached to avoid repeated GDI operations:
```csharp
private static Icon? _connectedIcon;
private static Icon? _disconnectedIcon;
// ... etc
```

### Session Tracking and Polling

The client tracks active agent sessions with intelligent display logic:

**Session State:**
- Main session: Primary user conversation
- Sub-sessions: Background tasks, tool executions
- Each session has: key, status, model, channel, activity

**Polling:**
- `RequestSessionsAsync()` called periodically (every 5 seconds when connected)
- Gateway responds with session list
- Client updates internal `_sessions` dictionary

**Display Selection Algorithm:**
1. Active main session always takes priority
2. Currently displayed session kept if still active (prevents flipping)
3. Falls back to most recently active sub-session
4. 3-second debounce prevents jitter during rapid changes

**Why This Matters:**
Without stable selection, the activity display would rapidly flip between sessions during concurrent operations, creating a poor user experience.

### Logging

File-based logging with automatic rotation:

**Log File:**
- Location: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenClawTray\openclaw-tray.log`
- Rotation: When log exceeds 5MB, old log → `openclaw-tray.log.old`
- Thread-safe: Uses lock for concurrent writes

**Log Levels:**
- `INFO` - Normal operation (connections, events)
- `WARN` - Recoverable issues (reconnects, timeouts)
- `ERROR` - Failures (connection errors, exceptions)
- `DEBUG` - Detailed diagnostics (only in DEBUG builds)

**Format:**
```
[2026-02-01 12:34:56.789] [INFO] Gateway connected, waiting for challenge...
[2026-02-01 12:34:57.123] [WARN] Reconnecting with 2000ms backoff...
[2026-02-01 12:34:58.456] [ERROR] Connection failed: Host not found
```

**Debug Output:**
In DEBUG builds, logs are also written to Visual Studio Output window via `System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine()`.

**Security:**
Sensitive data (authentication tokens) are never logged.

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

The `OpenClaw.Shared.Tests` project contains comprehensive tests for the shared library:

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with detailed output
dotnet test --verbosity detailed

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AgentActivityTests"
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ 68 tests for data models (AgentActivity, ChannelHealth, SessionInfo, GatewayUsageInfo)
- ✅ 20 tests for gateway client utilities (notification classification, tool mapping, path formatting)
- ✅ All tests are pure unit tests (no network, no file system, no external dependencies)

See [tests/OpenClaw.Shared.Tests/README.md](tests/OpenClaw.Shared.Tests/README.md) for detailed test documentation.

### Manual Testing Without Live Gateway

You can test the UI and basic functionality without a running gateway:

**Tray App:**
1. Launch the app: `dotnet run --project src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI`
2. Right-click tray icon → **Settings**
3. Enter a dummy gateway URL (e.g., `ws://localhost:18789`)
4. The app will show "Disconnected" status but you can:
   - Test the tray menu structure
   - Open Settings dialog and configure preferences
   - Test auto-start functionality
   - View logs

**Command Palette:**
1. Deploy the extension: `.\tools\cmdpal-dev.ps1 deploy`
2. Open PowerToys Command Palette (Win+Alt+Space)
3. Type "OpenClaw"
4. Commands will show but most require a connected gateway to function

### Manual Test Scenarios

#### Tray Icon States

1. **Disconnected (Gray)**: 
   - Start app without gateway running
   - Verify icon is gray
   - Verify tooltip shows "Disconnected"

2. **Connecting (Amber)**:
   - Configure valid gateway URL but don't start gateway yet
   - Restart app
   - Briefly observe amber icon during connection attempt

3. **Connected (Green)**:
   - Start gateway
   - Verify icon turns green
   - Verify tooltip shows "Connected"

4. **Error (Red)**:
   - Connect to gateway, then stop gateway
   - Verify icon turns red after timeout

5. **Activity Badge**:
   - Connect to gateway
   - Send a chat message that triggers tool use
   - Verify small colored dot appears on tray icon during tool execution

#### Notifications

1. **Toast Notifications**:
   - Connect to gateway
   - Send a message that triggers a chat response
   - Verify Windows toast notification appears (if enabled)
   - Click toast → should open relevant UI

2. **Notification History**:
   - Right-click tray → **Notification History**
   - Verify past notifications are listed
   - Test filtering by category

3. **Notification Settings**:
   - Settings → Disable notifications
   - Send a chat message
   - Verify no toast appears (but history still records it)

#### WebChat Panel

1. **Open WebChat**:
   - Right-click tray → **Open Web Chat**
   - Verify window opens with WebView2 content
   - Test sending a message

2. **Window State Persistence**:
   - Move/resize WebChat window
   - Close and reopen
   - Verify position/size restored (future feature)

3. **WebView2 Fallback**:
   - Test on system without WebView2 Runtime
   - Verify graceful fallback (opens browser instead)

## CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and release automation.

**Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Trigger Events:**
- Push to `main` or `master` branch
- Pull requests to `main` or `master`
- Git tags matching `v*` (e.g., `v1.2.3`) for releases

### Build Matrix

The CI builds multiple configurations:

**Test Job:**
- Runs on `windows-latest`
- Builds Shared library, Tray app (WinForms), Tray app (WinUI), Tests
- Runs unit tests: `dotnet test tests/OpenClaw.Shared.Tests`
- Uses GitVersion for semantic versioning

**Build Job (Tray):**
- Matrix: `win-x64`, `win-arm64`
- Builds WinUI Tray app for both architectures
- Publishes self-contained executables

### Adding New Features

**Example: Adding a New Gateway Event Type**

1. **Add Model** (`OpenClaw.Shared/Models.cs`):
   ```csharp
   public class MyNewEventData
   {
       public string Property { get; set; } = "";
   }
   ```

2. **Add Event** (`OpenClaw.Shared/OpenClawGatewayClient.cs`):
   ```csharp
   public event EventHandler<MyNewEventData>? MyNewEvent;
   ```

3. **Parse Event** (`OpenClawGatewayClient.cs`, in `ListenForMessagesAsync`):
   ```csharp
   if (eventType == "my_new_event")
   {
       var data = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<MyNewEventData>(json);
       MyNewEvent?.Invoke(this, data);
   }
   ```

4. **Handle in Tray App** (`OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI/App.xaml.cs`):
   ```csharp
   _gatewayClient.MyNewEvent += OnMyNewEvent;
   
   private void OnMyNewEvent(object? sender, MyNewEventData e)
   {
       _dispatcherQueue?.TryEnqueue(() =>
       {
           // Update UI
       });
   }
   ```

5. **Add Tests** (`tests/OpenClaw.Shared.Tests/`):
   ```csharp
   [Fact]
   public void MyNewEventData_DisplaysCorrectly()
   {
       var data = new MyNewEventData { Property = "test" };
       Assert.Equal("test", data.Property);
   }
   ```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Build Error: "Windows SDK not found"**
   - Install Windows 10 SDK 19041 or later
   - Or build Shared library only: `dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Shared`

2. **Command Palette Extension Not Loading**
   - Verify correct architecture (x64 on x64, arm64 on ARM64)
   - Check PowerToys version (latest recommended)
   - View logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\PowerToys\CmdPal\Logs`
   - Run "Reload" command in Command Palette after deploying

3. **WebView2 Error 0x8007000B on ARM64**
   - Both Tray app AND Command Palette must be ARM64
   - Rebuild: `dotnet build src/OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI -r win-arm64`

4. **Tray Icon Not Appearing**
   - Check Windows notification area settings
   - Verify app is running (Task Manager)
   - Check logs: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenClawTray\openclaw-tray.log`

5. **Gateway Connection Fails**
   - Verify gateway is running: `curl http://localhost:18789/health`
   - Check gateway URL in settings
   - Verify authentication token is correct
   - Check firewall settings
